# Analyzing-Banking-Trends-
In the dynamic realm of banking and finance, the project 'Analyzing Banking Trends: Customer Transactions and Regional Impact' delves into transaction data to extract insights on customer behavior, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning with a global perspective.
# Overview
In the fast-paced world of banking and finance, understanding customer behavior and the regional impact of transactions is essential for effective decision-making and strategic planning. This project, titled "Analyzing Banking Trends," employs SQL and Python to explore and analyze extensive transaction data, aiming to gain valuable insights into customer behavior patterns and their implications on different world regions.
# Objectives
Customer Behavior Analysis: Utilize SQL queries to extract and analyze transaction data, identifying patterns in customer behavior such as spending habits, saving preferences, and investment choices.
Regional Impact Assessment: Leverage Python for geographic analysis, assessing the impact of transactions on different world regions, considering economic, cultural, and regulatory factors.
Insightful Reporting: Develop Python scripts for generating insightful reports, providing stakeholders with actionable information for decision-making.
# Technologies Used
SQL: For querying and analyzing transaction data stored in relational databases, extracting relevant information for customer behavior analysis.
Python: Utilized for geographic analysis, scripting, and generating reports. Libraries such as Pandas and NumPy may be employed for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.
# Data Sources: 
 The project leverages three key tables that provide valuable information for analysis:
# world_regions table:
 This table contains data on various world regions and their corresponding codes and names. It serves as a reference to categorize customers based on their regional affiliation.
# user_nodes table:
 The user_nodes table holds crucial details about consumers' banking nodes, including their unique consumer IDs, associated region IDs, node IDs, start dates, and end dates. This data enables us to identify the specific banking nodes to which customers are connected and their duration of association.
# user_transaction table:
 This table is a comprehensive repository of customer transactions, containing data such as consumer IDs, transaction dates, types of transactions, and transaction amounts. Analyzing this data allows us to uncover patterns in customer spending and financial behaviors.
